# COSC5P30-Final-Project-SportGNN-
This repository contains the code and paper related to my COSC 5P30 Final Project on SportGNN

The code was written in a jupyter notebook and can be run if the data is in the same folder as the notebook. 

The data for the project was too big to upload to GitHub, but you can download it from MoneyPuck https://moneypuck.com/data.htm by scrolling down to the section "Download Shot Data" and downloading the shot data for the following seasons: 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-24.

If you'd like to run the code and can't get the data from MoneyPuck email me and I will try to figure out how to send it to you.
